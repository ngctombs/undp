Human Development Indicators

The data used for calculating the Human Development Index (HDI) and other composite indices featured in the Human Development Report are provided by a variety of public international sources and represent the best and most current statistics available for those indicators at the time of report preparation.  Calculations of HDI values and country rankings are the sole responsibility of the Human Development Report Office. The 2013 Human Development Report, an editorially independent publication commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme, was published in print and online on March 14, 2013.
